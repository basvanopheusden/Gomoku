% test driver for running MCS 
% with advice on how to choose the tuning parameters
%
% applied to the Jones test functions with default boxes
%
% To solve your own problem, copy this file (to ownmcs.m, say)
% and adapt the first part labelled `problem definition'.
% Then run the driver by typing `ownmcs' at the Matlab prompt.
%
% If you are not satisfied with the results, or if you want to play 
% with the tuning parameters, you also need to adapt the second part
% labelled `change MCS settings'. In particular, for wide bounds,
% you'll probably get better results if you supply your own 
% initialization list.
% 
% On typing `runmcs' at the Matlab prompt,
% the unmodified file produces test results for the six-hump camel
% function; by only changing the data assignment you can also get
% results for the other test functions from Jones et al.
% You may also play with the bounds by modifying the default bounds.

% smax governs the relative amount of global versus local search. By

% 
% Increasing nf allows to spend more time on boxes that have a chance 
% on their level to contain better points. This may be important for
% hard problems, or for problems with very wide bounds.
% 
% But in each case, it is unclear in advance what change would be most 
% beneficial to a particular problem.

% define initialization strategy
%
% for wide boxes, it is advisable (and for unbounded search regions
% strongly advisable) to define a customized initialization list
% that contains for each coordinate at least three reasonable values.
% Without such an initialization list, mcs makes default assumptions
% that roughly amount to estimating reasonable magnitudes from the 
% bounds and in case iinit=1 from assuming order unity if this is 
% within the bounds. 
%
% for a self-defined initialization list, the user should
% write an m-script file init0.m containing a matrix x0 with n
% rows and at least 3 columns and two n-vectors l and L 
% the ith column of x0 contains the initialization list
% values for the ith coordinate, their number is L(i), and
% x0(i,l(i)) is the ith coordinate of the initial point

iinit = 4;	% 0: simple initialization list
		%    (default for finite bounds;
		%     do not use this for very wide bounds)
		% 1: safeguarded initialization list
		%    (default for unbounded search regions)
		% 2: (5*u+v)/6, (u+v)/2, (u+5*v)/6
		% 3: initialization list with line searches
		% else: self-defined initialization list 
		%       stored in file init0.m

% parameters for local search
%
% A tiny gamma (default) gives a quite accurate but in higher 
% dimensions slow local search. Increasing gamma leads to less work 
% per local search but a less accurately localized minimizer
% 
% If it is known that the Hessian is sparse, providing the sparsity 
% pattern saves many function evaluations since the corresponding
% entries in the Hessian need not be estimated. The default pattern
% is a full matrix.
